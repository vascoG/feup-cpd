In the specification of the protocols we have strived to cover many common failure scenarios, given our failure model. However, we do not cover all the scenarios.

For example, if a node is down for a long time and it misses many membership events, the periodic MEMBERSHIP messages may not be enough for the node to learn the current membership of the cluster.

Another scenario is the possibility of the membership view of the node to which the client sent a request not being up-to-date and, therefore, the operation request will be sent to the wrong node, i.e. a node that is not responsible for the key.

Making your store tolerant to these failure scenarios or others that you may find, will give you additional credit up to 10%.

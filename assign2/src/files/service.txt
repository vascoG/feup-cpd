Each node must provides two interfaces.

2.1 Key-Value Store Interface

A key-value persistent store provides essentially three operations:

put(key, value)
which adds a key-value pair to the store

get(key)
which retrieves the value bound to a key

delete(key)
which deletes a key-value pair

2.2 Cluster Membership Interface

This interface allows to add/remove nodes to the cluster:

join()
which adds a node to the cluster

leave()
which removes a node from the cluster
